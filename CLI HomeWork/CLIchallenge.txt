1- How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

    mkdir .foldername  to create a hidden folder
    touch .filename    to create a hidden file

      ls -a    to view it

2- How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

   mkdir -p c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun
   
   If you want to create a folder and some folders inside it

   mkdir -p c/{Users,myusername,these,folders,are,just,for,fun}

3- How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

   first message
   second message
   

   echo "First message" >> test.txt
   echo "second message" >> test.txt
   

   we can also put them together inline 

   echo "first message second message" >> test.txt
